# MET Museum API Display
The Metropolitan Museum of Art comes to life in this virtual tour based on the [MET API](https://metmuseum.github.io/). A drop-down menu allows the user to select from the various departments. Once a department is selected, the user can traverse through the objects of said department. 

When available, the following metadata of each object is displayed:
* Image 
* Title
* Culture
* Period
* Date
* Medium
